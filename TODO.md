# Todo List

## Short Term

- Text output on client (use CSS Grid)
- world communication
- rooms
- room communication
- room movement
- items/inventory
- Think about extensibility engine at this point. 
- I don't like the message type system. Fix it. 
- Minimum password length requirement (config setting)
- Move to all-in-memory storage. Might require tearing out the session and auth providers stuff.


## Long Term

- Fix styles on login/signup/etc pages
- Monsters
- Combat
- Skills
- Magic
- Story
- Turkish Drunk Mode
- Hook up to SendGrid (or equivalent) to send registration emails, to prevent abuse. Or maybe just use a CAPTCHA? 
- Console Themes

## Nice-to-Have, but not on radar

- Localization support
